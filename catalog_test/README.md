# Catalog based testiing

Document was created to get test cases for the simple functionality of an enemy object in a game. This was created as part of a group project in class. 

## Step 1 - Find elementary items

- preconditions: conditions that must be true before running the test
- postconditions: the result of running the test
- variables: inputs and ouputs the program operates on
- operations: calculations performed using the variables
- definitions: stuff the tester should know about the program
